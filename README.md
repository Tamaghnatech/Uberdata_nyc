## About

The Uberdata NYC Project aims to analyze and visualize Uber ride data in the New York City area. It provides insights into ride patterns, popular routes, and other interesting trends. The project is implemented using [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for data analysis and visualization.

## Dataset Details

In New York City, all taxi vehicles are managed by the Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The TLC is responsible for licensing and regulating various types of taxis and for-hire vehicles. The dataset used in this project is the NYC TLC Trip Record data, which includes trip records from different types of vehicles:

- **Yellow Taxis:** Traditional taxis hailed on the street.
- **Green Taxis:** Introduced to improve taxi service availability in boroughs.
- **High-Volume For-Hire Vehicles (FHV):** Includes ride-hailing services like Uber, Lyft, Via, Juno, etc.

The dataset provides insights into taxi and for-hire vehicle trips in NYC and can be used to understand trip patterns, analyze user behavior, and predict demand.
